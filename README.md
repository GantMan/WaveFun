# WaveFun
Just messing around with React Native animation.  Hopefully some of the lessons shared in here will help someone else looking to mess with animation as well.

# TODO:
* `useNativeDriver: true` should work for the sine wave, but it doesn't - [issue #3](https://github.com/GantMan/WaveFun/issues/3)
* Sine doesn't keep shape over long periods of time due to not being actual `Math.sin` driven
* Move re-usable component over to https://github.com/GantMan/useless-things
